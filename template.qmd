We begin by loading the required packages.

```{julia}
using Revise                      # <1>
using RainwaterHarvesting         # <2>
```

1. `Revise` allows us to update code without restarting Julia.
2. We load the `RainwaterHarvesting` package that contains our simulation tools.

### Setting the file path

Next, we specify the path to the rainfall data file and read it in.

```{julia}
filepath = "data/25.txt" # <1>   
rainfall_data = RainfallData(filepath) # <2>
```

1. This is the path to the rainfall data file for the station of interest.
2. This creates a `RainfallData` object containing the rainfall data for the specified station.

If we dig under the hood a bit, we can see that there are two main pieces of information:

- `station_info`: a dictionary containing information about the station, such as its name and location.
- `annual_data`: a dictionary mapping years to `AnnualRainfallData` objects, each containing the date and precipitation data for a given year.

### Plotting the Data

We can plot the data for one or all of the years to verify that it looks correct.

```{julia}
plot(rainfall_data) # <1>
```

1. This `plot` function is defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl) and is a thin wrapper around the Plots.jl package.

### Discussion

After cleaning, data from 48 were kept. This means that there are 48 years of valid data. Several years around 2011-2014 don’t contain any data due to the major drought from 2012-2017 in Ceará Brazil. The missing data during drought years could lead to an overestimation of water availability and how reliable our system is. My model could also be slightly inaccurate because it would be based on data from when there was sufficient rainfall each year, and this could lead to a model that isn’t equipped to deal with drought years. These are just some considerations I have to keep in mind. However, the available data is still sufficient for meaningful risk assessment because even without the years from the drought, there is enough data to make meaningful predictions.

## Understanding the Theoretical Model



### Mass Balance Equation



### Inflow ($Q_t$)



### Consumption



## Model Implementation and Testing

### Defining the Model Parameters

We can define the model parameters with sensible default values.
You will have the opportunity to change these values later.

```{julia}
#| output: false
param = ModelParameters(          # <1>
    runoff_coefficient=0.85,      # <2>
    roof_area_m2=45.0,            # <3>
    first_flush_mm=2.0,           # <4>
    tank_capacity_L=16000.0       # <5>
)
```

1. This creates a `ModelParameters` object with the specified parameters.
2. The runoff coefficient ($\eta$) is a measure of how much of the rain that falls on the roof ends up in the tank.
3. The roof area ($A$) is the area of the roof that the rain falls on.
4. The first flush volume ($V_f$) is the volume of rain that is discarded because it is dirty.
5. The tank capacity ($V_\text{max}$) is the maximum volume of the tank.

### Running the Simulation for One Year

Let's run the model for the year 1981.

```{julia}
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]    # <1>
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param) # <2>
p1 = plot(results_1981)                                 # <3>
```

1. We select the annual rainfall data for the year 1981.
2. We run the simulation for the year 1981.
3. We plot the results, again using a `plot` function defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl).

To compare rainfall and tank volume:

```{julia}
p2 = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(p2, p1, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
```

Observe how the tank's water level responds to rainfall events.
Note any periods when the tank runs dry or overflows.

### Reliability Analysis

We can run simulations for all years, one at a time, and then check how many times the tank runs dry.
You can run simulations for all years at once with the following code:

```{julia}
all_years = sort(collect(keys(rainfall_data.annual_data)))          # <1>
all_results = [run_timesteps(rainfall_data.annual_data[year], param) for year in all_years]   # <2>
any_failures = [!isempty(result.failure_dates) for result in all_results]  # <3>
println("Number of years with failures: ", sum(any_failures), " out of ", length(all_years))  # <4>
```

1. We get all the years in order.
2. We run the simulation for each year.
3. We check if any failures occurred.
4. We print the number of years with failures and the total number of years.
